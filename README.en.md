An Emby client for Android TV, built for a remote control rather than a touchscreen.

**Latest version 0.2.8**, released 2026-09-18. Requires Android 6.0 or newer
(API 23).

## Download

| Download | Best for | Size |

Not sure which one? Take `universal`. It is a larger download and works on everything.

## Install

Android TV will not install an app from a file until you allow it. The prompt appears the
first time and points at the right settings screen.

**With a file manager or sideload app** such as Downloader or Send Files to TV: copy the
APK across, open it, and accept the install prompt.

**With adb**, from a computer on the same network:

```bash
adb connect <tv-ip>:5555
adb install -r bemplayer-0.2.8-universal.apk
```

Then open Bemplayer from the Android TV home screen and enter your Emby server address,
for example `http://192.168.1.10:8096`.

## Updates

Bemplayer checks for new versions on its own and can install them without a computer.
Settings, then Updates, then Check now. Auto check is on by default and can be turned off
on the same screen.

The first update asks you to allow Bemplayer to install apps. That permission is what lets
it replace itself, and the app takes you straight to the setting.

## Using the remote

| Key                | In the player                                      |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Centre, play/pause | Play or pause                                      |
| Left, right        | Seek. Hold to go faster: 10s, 30s, 1m, 5m          |
| Up                 | Playback diagnostics                               |
| Down               | Audio and subtitle tracks                          |
| Back               | Close the menu, then hide the controls, then leave |

Anywhere else, Back goes back one screen and never closes the app. Hold Back to be asked
whether to quit, which is the only way out.

The green button opens diagnostics from any screen, which is the quickest way to get
information for a bug report.

## Reporting a problem

Open an issue at https://github.com/liveinaus/bemplayer/issues. The most useful thing you can attach
is a log export: press the green button on the remote, then Export, and the screen tells
you where the files landed.

Please include your device model, the Android version and the Emby server version.
